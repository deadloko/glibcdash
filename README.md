To generate dash documentation you need dashing utility (https://github.com/technosophos/dashing) in your path.

Run this command to generate docset:
<pre><code>dashing build</code></pre>

To use docset in Zeal copy it to your docset directory (in linux - <code>~/.local/share/Zeal/Zeal/docsets/</code>)

More information available at https://zealdocs.org/.
